# C++ Projects for Learning Stuff

Projects taken from: [G4G](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/).  

Implementations may vary in `commitment`. I like the more complex projects - ones that take a couple of days for me to solve.  

I'm planning on adding CI to have automated builds after every commit. Some of the projects will contain unit tests.
